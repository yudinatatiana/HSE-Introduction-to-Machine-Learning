# Licensing and redistribution

## Code

### "Open" licenses

#### Exercise: read the Wikipedia articles on Apache, BSD, and MIT licenses. Describe the similarities and the differences.

Similarities:

 - Permissive type and require to keep the license file considering the linking, distribution and modification
 - No software warranty
 - Derivative works may be distributed under the terms of another license
 - Commercial use allowed
 - Does not specify the territory for which the license is granted

Differences:

 - Some versions of the BSD license require to include the disclaimer when you distribute a
product unlike MIT license
 - MIT and BSD: modified files can be unmarked
 - Apache: modified files must be marked
 - Apache: require to keep license file with the NOTICE file (if NOTICE file exists)
 - Apache: patent rights allowed

## Art

#### Exercise: Pick a creative work (or make up a fictional one); come up with three obviously non-commercial uses of this work.

MCU fanart

1. use in video for youtube
2. repost by thematic group
3. art can be used as an illustration in a comic history lecture

#### Exercise: Now argue that all three of these uses are commercial.

1. even if the author of the video does not have an affiliate program with youtube, ads are still shown during the video
2. it can be assumed that reposting the work of this artist can attract a new audience to the group, if this group sells thematic merch, then this can lead to an increase in profits
3. the lecture can be closed and paid

### Data

#### Exercise: What is the effect on science reproducibility if the data set is not liberally licensed?

In some cases, it will be impossible to reproduce the results of the study.
For example, data was collected using web scraping. 
Given that some data sources are constantly updated (news), it will be difficult to collect the same corpus for other researchers.
A dataset without a liberally license can have many prohibitions on its use, which can hinder scientific research if it is a very specific and one-of-a-kind data corpus.

#### Exercise: give an example of a proprietary data source; what could you do with that data if it were liberally licensed?

I would like to see more audiobooks with texts in the public domain. Such data would be very helpful in the field of speech recognition and generation.
