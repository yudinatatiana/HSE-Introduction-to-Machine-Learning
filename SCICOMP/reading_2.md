## Numerical representations

### Binary and hexadecimal representations

#### Exercise: build a list of all four-digit binary numbers, and compute the corresponding single-digit hexadecimal number.

four-digit binary numbers | single-digit hexadecimal number
--------------------------|---------------------------------
0000                      |0
0001                      |1
0010                      |2
0011                      |3
0100                      |4
0101                      |5
0110                      |6
0111                      |7
1000                      |8
1001                      |9
1010                      |A
1011                      |B
1100                      |C
1101                      |D
1110                      |E
1111                      |F

### Floating point numbers

#### Exercise: Pretend we use a naïve floating-point format with 5bit mantissa and 3bit exponent (base-2). What is the smallest possible positive number representable? What is the largest positive number representable? The first bit of each is used for sign:

The smallest possible positive number representable: [00001][111] = 1 \* 2^0 \* 10^(-3) = 0.001

The largest positive number representable: [01111][011] = 15 \* 10^3 = 15000

#### Exercise: use python to check this:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

print(repr(Decimal(0.1)))
```

```
Decimal('0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625')
```

#### Exercise: what is the best approximation of 0.01?

```python
print(repr(Decimal(0.01)))
```

```
Decimal('0.01000000000000000020816681711721685132943093776702880859375')
```

## Simple data structures: lists, trees, graphs

### Linked lists

#### Exercise: use diagrams like the above to explain how to delete an item from a linked list.

     |x[0]|next|--->---|x[1]|next|--->---|x[2]|NULL|



     |x[0]|next|                    |x[2]|NULL|

                \                 /

                   \            /

                      \       /

                      |x[1]|next |



     |x[0]|next|----------->-------------|x[2]|NULL|

                     | x[1] | next |


### Trees

#### Exercise: assemble the numbers 1-10 into binary search trees which are (a) maximally unbalanced to the left, (b) balanced, (c) one step from balanced.

a) maximally unbalanced to the left

                       10
                      /
                     9
                    /
                   8
                  /
                 7
                /
               6
              /
             5
            /
           4
          /
         3
        /
       2
      /
     1

b) balanced

             5
          /     \
         3       8
        / \     / \
       2   4   7   9
      /       /     \
     1       6       10

c) one step from balanced.

           5
          / \
         3   8
        /   / \
       2   7   9
      /   /     \
     1   6       10
        /
       4

### Graphs

#### Exercise: assemble a directed acyclic graph with the numbers 1-12 by strict divisibility: an edge from A to B if B/A is prime. There are no directed cycles, but some nodes do have multiple paths to them. (These form cycles if you ignore the direction.) Which ones? Explain how to decide if a number will have multiple paths to it.

```
  (11) <-    ->(5) - > (10)
         \  /      /
          \/      /
   (7) <- (1) -> (2)
           |      | \
           v      |  \
          (3)     |   -> (4) -> (8)
           | \    v
           v  -> (6)
          (9)     |
                  v
                 (12)
```

6, 10, 12 have several paths included in them due to the fact that they can be formed by two prime numbers.
For example, 6 is divisible by 2 and 3 (boths prime).

#### Exercise: Identify several maximal spanning trees in the divisibility graph from the previous exercise.

#### Exercise: model acquaintance using a graph (vertices are people, an edge between A and B means A knows B). Model it with a directed graph. How are these different?

## Cryptographic ideas

### Hashing

#### Exercise: this doesn't mean the file was transferred correctly; why not?

This may not work if the errors in the file are the same size as the original data.

#### Exercise: do the same for files with "cat" and "cat2" instead of "hi" and "hi2"

```
$ echo cat > testfile; echo cat2 > testfile2
$ md5sum testfile testfile2
54b8617eca0e54c7d3c8e6732c6b687a  testfile
4307ab44204de40235bad8c66cce0ae9  testfile2
$ sha1sum testfile testfile2
8f6abfbac8c81b55f9005f7ec09e32d29e40eb40  testfile

$ sha512sum testfile testfile2

```

### Symmetric cryptography

#### Exercise: implement the Caesar cipher in python, which advances each letter of 'M' by 'SEC = n': enc(1, "a") = "b", etc.

*you can find in reading_2.py*

```python
def caesar_cipher(text, step, alphabets):

    def shift(alphabet):
        return alphabet[step:] + alphabet[:step]

    shifted_alphabets = tuple(map(shift, alphabets))
    joined_aphabets = ''.join(alphabets)
    joined_shifted_alphabets = ''.join(shifted_alphabets)
    table = str.maketrans(joined_aphabets, joined_shifted_alphabets)
    return text.translate(table)
```
	
```python
import string
alphabets = (string.ascii_lowercase, string.ascii_uppercase, string.digits)
caesar_cipher('hello', step=4, alphabets=alphabets)
```

```
'uryyb'
```
